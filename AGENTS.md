# AGENTS

- Do not bypass commit hooks.
- Run type check and lint.
- Fix all lint errors.
- Use context 7 to get relevant data.
- Skills only provide generic advice, not real docs.
- Environment variables must be declared in `turbo.json` (`env`/`globalEnv`) and relevant tasks must include `.env*` in `inputs` for correct cache invalidation.
