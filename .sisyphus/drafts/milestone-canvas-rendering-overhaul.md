## Requirements (confirmed)

- Plan file name: `.sisyphus/plans/milestone-canvas-rendering-overhaul.md`.
- Run Momus review loop until it passes.

## Technical Decisions

## Research Findings

## Open Questions

- Which surface owns the canvas rendering (web app, Android app, backend, other)?
- What problems must the overhaul solve (performance, visual fidelity, correctness bugs, API redesign)?
- Scope boundaries: what is explicitly out of scope?
- Target success criteria (FPS, memory, export fidelity, latency, crash rate)?
- Test strategy preference (TDD, tests-after, manual-only)?
